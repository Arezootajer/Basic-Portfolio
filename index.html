				Hi, I am Arezoo,but here at work people call me Zoey!<br>
I am graduated from master program in software engineer at 2013 from Malaysia and worked in a loan company there for almost 1 year.
At 2014 I moved US and I am living in San Jose. Currently I am working for Heatscape.com which is a manufacture company. I designed their website from scratch. Also I am in developing team to develop their database in .net framework. 
I am joining to San Jose state for my second master program in engineering management at evening. But this semester I took off to join to boot camp coding in UC Berkley extension.
The fun part about me that I am not sure it is fun or not, I always wanted to be a painter when I was kid. I donâ€™t know why I am trying to be developer. But I can say, I am enjoying to develop and design websites.
