				Hi, I am Arezoo,Here at work people call me Zoey!<br>
I am graduated from master program in software engineer at 2013 from Malaysia and worked in a loan company there for almost 1 year.
At 2014, I moved  to the US and I am living in San Jose. Currently I am working for Heatscape.com which is a manufacture company. I designed their website from scratch with Joomla. 
Also I am in developing team to develop their database in .net framework. 
I am joining to San Jose state for my second master program in engineering management at evening. But this semester I took off to join to boot camp coding in UC Berkley extension.
The fun part about me is that I always wanted to be a painter when I was kid. I donâ€™t know why I am trying to be developer maybe because of design part or front end coding. But I can say, I am enjoying to be a software engineer.
